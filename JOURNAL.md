# kanban-pro — Journal

## 2026-07-10 — competitive survey: the "no prior art" claim was overreaching

- **Why:** the README asserted the concept combo "has no direct prior art (web survey,
  2026-07-05)". That survey was never re-checked, and two of the README's factual claims
  had gone stale. Re-ran it across 16 products with citations →
  [docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md).
- **Two claims were simply WRONG and are now corrected:**
  1. *"Classic kanbans ❌ MCP-native."* Trello ships an **official** MCP server
     (`https://mcp.trello.com/v1` — verified by fetching Atlassian's own doc), as do Jira,
     Linear, and GitHub (`github/github-mcp-server`, ★31k). Planka, Vikunja, Kanboard,
     Taiga, Wekan and Focalboard all have community servers. Practically every classic
     kanban is MCP-reachable; what they lack is coordination semantics, not MCP.
  2. *"Agent boards (Agent Kanban, Flux)"* was written as if half-imagined. **Both are
     real** — verified via the GitHub API: `sirsjg/flux` (★91, MIT, active 2026-06-29),
     and "Agent Kanban" maps to `eyalzh/kanban-mcp` (★40) / `kaban-board/kaban` (★47).
     Also found `multidimensionalcats/kanban-mcp` (★75), the closest single peer, which
     **already ships structured work reports with cycle-time metrics**.
- **What survives scrutiny:** **atomic claim/lease with TTL+heartbeat appears in ZERO of
  the sixteen** — every other tool's "assignment" is a last-write-wins field two agents can
  both grab. A resumable cursor feed exists nowhere in the OSS/agent set (Trello's `since`
  polling and Linear's GraphQL cursor are the nearest, both proprietary SaaS). Capability
  honesty (native/polyfilled/unavailable) appears unique, even among the multi-backend
  proxies (Composio, Unified.to).
- **What does NOT survive, and is now said out loud:** MCP kanbans are a crowded category
  (≥10). Self-hosting is table stakes. **Jira has had a real server-side transition state
  machine for ~20 years** — our enforced flow is novel only *in a self-hosted MCP-first
  agent board*. Work reports (multidimensionalcats), archive-first deletes (Backlog.md) and
  the proxy concept (Composio, Unified.to) all have prior art. Single-user with no
  permissions is a liability, not a simplification. The README now leads the comparison with
  "you probably want one of the others".
- **Also flagged:** Focalboard is effectively dead (its README literally says *"This
  repository is currently not maintained"*, verified) and its successor is in maintenance
  mode; Planka is **fair-code, not OSI open source**; Kanboard is maintenance-mode; and
  Kanboard's famous WIP limits **do not hard-block** — the column just turns red.
- **Method note:** the research subagent got two counts wrong earlier in the day (claimed 27
  port methods, and that methods.md listed 39 tools against a stated 37). Both were false —
  25 and an exact 37-name match. Every load-bearing claim here was re-verified directly
  (GitHub API for stars/dates/licence, WebFetch for the Trello MCP doc and Focalboard's
  README). **Do not merge subagent research without checking its numbers.**

## 2026-07-10 — `llms.txt`: the repo answers "do I need this?" without the human reading it

- **Goal:** a newcomer with no checkout types one line into their agent —
  `Do I need this? https://github.com/galvani/kanban-pro` — and gets an honest verdict,
  then an install they never had to type. The instructions therefore have to live in the
  *repo*, not in a prompt the user has to find and paste. Hence
  [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) — the emerging convention, root path, agent-facing.
  (A thin `PROMPT.md` held the one-liners for a few hours; folded into the README's top
  callout and deleted the same day — one more file to keep in sync bought nothing that a
  four-line blockquote didn't.)
- **`llms.txt` is written adversarially against its own project**, because a brief that
  sells gets ignored (or worse, believed): an explicit WORKS vs NOT BUILT split (no CLI,
  no Jira adapter, no bulk ops, no push notifications, no `PRO-12` keys, no write-through);
  a "who should NOT use it" section naming teams, non-agent users, and anyone whose agent's
  built-in to-do list already suffices; honest per-alternative trade-offs; the cost of
  backing out; and the **no-LICENSE** catch stated as a legal fact the agent must surface
  before the human builds on it. The agent is told: if they don't need it, say so and stop.
- **Install path verified, not assumed:** `uvx --from git+https://github.com/galvani/kanban-pro
  kanban-pro-mcp` builds and runs from a clean cache — no clone needed. **Trap found:**
  `--print-config` emits the bare `kanban-pro-mcp`, which is only on PATH after
  `uv tool install`, *not* after `uvx`. Registering what `--print-config` prints would
  therefore give a newcomer a broken MCP entry. `llms.txt` spells out both spawn forms and
  registers the full `uvx` command by default.
- Also encoded: always pass `--actor` (else every write is attributed to `unknown`), back
  up any config before editing, never clobber an existing `kanban-pro` server entry, and
  **prove the install by calling the tools** (create → move → `list_changes` shows your
  actor) rather than trusting that a config entry means success.

## 2026-07-10 — repo went public; docs reconciled against the code

- **Published** to `github.com/galvani/kanban-pro` (public). Pre-flight scan: no secrets,
  tokens, `.env`/`.db`/`.pem` files, or personal paths in the tree or anywhere in history.
  README still declares "all rights reserved"; **no `LICENSE` file exists**, so the repo
  is legally read-only to visitors until one is added.
- **Why the doc pass:** README/SPEC/AGENTS/methods.md hadn't been touched since 2026-07-05
  while thirteen commits landed. Public repo ⇒ the docs are now the first thing a reader
  sees, and several were not merely stale but **wrong** (claiming features that don't
  exist, and missing ones that do).
- **Factual errors corrected** (all verified against source, not memory):
  - Tool count was **28** in README (and 23 in TODO); the server registers **37 tools +
    9 resources**. Counted from the `@mcp.tool` decorators.
  - `docs/methods.md` documented `bulk_create/move/update/archive` as the live MCP
    surface. **`bulk_` appears nowhere in `kanban_pro/`** — never implemented. Marked
    _(planned)_, likewise in SPEC's canonical-operations list.
  - `AGENTS.md` and SPEC's project-structure blocks listed **`cli/` and `app.py`**;
    neither exists. Entry points are the three `pyproject.toml` scripts.
  - Decision 8 said create/add ops **REQUIRE** an idempotency key; it shipped
    **optional**. Documented the divergence and the reason (mandatory would break every
    existing caller) rather than quietly restating the spec.
  - `list_changes` was described as the only feed and durable push as 🔜; **`wait_changes`
    (long-poll) has shipped**.
  - SPEC's "Open Questions" listed Q13–Q17 as live; QUESTIONS.md says all seventeen are
    resolved. SPEC now agrees with QUESTIONS.md.
  - "Not a kanban UI" vs. a shipped web board: kept the *NOT* entry but qualified it —
    the board is a thin on-demand consumer of `core/`, not the product.
- **Undocumented features written up:** structured **work reports**
  (`record_work_report` / `answer_work_report_question`, the section taxonomy, the
  "never rewrite the blob" rule, `kanban://work-report-schema`), the `ext.session`
  convention + derived liveness, `list_transitions`/`list_flows`, and the UI's real
  feature set (card detail, session-log tail, retry).
  Also fixed: `claim_card`/`heartbeat_claim` were documented with `ttl_seconds=900`; the
  code defaults to **3600**, and both take an `owner` override.
- **New: [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)** — the "how do I actually use
  this" guide the repo lacked, now the first link in the README's doc list. Covers
  profiles, actors, the three per-profile state DBs, WIP limits (**on the column** —
  `flows.yaml`'s `wip_limits:` key is reserved and *ignored*, a real trap), the flow file
  (search order, resolution chain, unmodeled lanes, audited `force`), the attention flag,
  listeners (`wait_changes` + a stored cursor, with the loop), and where data lives.
- **Where data lives — written down for the first time.** With a backend attached, the
  backend is the system of record: cards are never copied into kanban-pro's SQLite, `ext`
  is passthrough into the backend's own fields, Tier-1 rules (WIP, flow) store nothing at
  all, and kanban-pro supplies an overlay *only* for data a backend has nowhere to put.
  Documented with the status split rather than the aspiration: **write-through encoding
  is designed, not built** — today's Tier-2 comment/relation polyfills sit in the overlay.
- **Gotcha for future doc edits:** `docs/methods.md`'s MCP tool list is hand-maintained
  and drifted silently. The *machine* source of truth is the generated block in
  `examples/skills/*/SKILL.md` (`uv run python -m tests.toolref --write`, guarded by
  `tests/test_toolref.py`). Nothing guards the prose — so re-count from
  `grep -c '^@mcp\.tool'` when touching it.

## 2026-07-10 — board went stale on automatic moves: SSE stream made self-healing

- **Symptom (Jan):** a card the dispatcher moves automatically (e.g. `ready → running`)
  did not appear to move on an open board — not a drag/flow-rejection issue, the live
  board just wasn't updating for foreign-process writes.
- **Root cause:** the board is push-only by design ("No polling timers", `board.html`) and
  had **no SSE recovery**. `es.onerror` only dimmed the live-dot; `connect()` guarded with
  `if (es) return`, so a permanently-CLOSED `EventSource` — killed by a server restart,
  laptop sleep, or a dropped connection — was never replaced, silently freezing the board
  until a manual reload. The server pipeline itself was healthy (verified: dispatcher
  `moved` events are recorded and the SSE endpoint replays them).
- **Fix (three parts):** (1) `connect()` now recreates a CLOSED stream instead of bailing,
  and `es.onerror` schedules a 2s-backoff reconnect + `refresh()` to catch moves missed
  while dark; (2) `visibilitychange`/`online` handlers `refresh()` on regaining focus or
  connectivity — heals the common sleep/background freeze; (3) the server's idle SSE loop
  emits a `: ping` heartbeat (~every 16s) so a dead connection surfaces as a write error
  (driving the client reconnect) instead of hanging silent, and intermediaries don't buffer
  an event-less stream. `test_api` green; ruff clean.

- **Every claimed card now carries a link to its agent's session log**, tailed live in a
  modal (like the old Hermes origin board). The board tile gets a `▶ <owner>` chip when a
  live claim exists (+ 📜 when a log is linked); the card modal has a **session log**
  button that opens a viewer — LIVE-polling every 2s while the claim is held, static once
  released.
- **One convention, both agent kinds (`ext.session`):** `{actor, log, kind}` where `log`
  is a `*.jsonl`/`*.log` path under `$HOME`/tmp. Interactive Claude Code workers stamp
  their transcript path (kanban-worker skill documents the derivation); dispatcher-run
  cards keep working via the older `ext.work.log`, used as an automatic fallback source.
- **Running-vs-done is DERIVED from the live claim, not a stored flag** — a crashed lease
  correctly reads as "done" once it expires, no stale "running" state to clean up. This is
  why the log pointer lives on card `ext` (persists for the done-log) while liveness comes
  from the claim (`ext._claim`, injected into the snapshot like `_last_comment`).
- **API:** `/api/cards/{id}/worker-log` generalised to `/session-log` (single endpoint, no
  parallel path) — normalises a Claude Code transcript into compact `{ts, role, kind,
  text}` entries so the browser needn't know the transcript schema, and supports
  `?after=<eof_offset>` incremental reads (only whole lines consumed, so a half-written
  last line waits for the next poll). Same path guard as before, extended to `.jsonl`.
  Card detail + board snapshot now expose the live claim.

## 2026-07-06 — move_card validates columns; foreign MCP doc resources reviewed; notifier example

- **`move_card` now rejects a nonexistent target column (NotFound)** in both adapters +
  contract test. Found the hard way: the dispatcher force-moved a card to a guessed
  column id, kanban-pro accepted it, and the card silently fell off every lane view.
  An id typo must fail fast, not orphan the card.
- **Foreign session's +257 lines in `mcp/__init__.py` reviewed and kept:** four
  self-documenting resources (`kanban://event-schema`, `work-distribution`, `workflow`,
  `domain`) so clients don't have to read code — content verified accurate. Fixed en
  route: 9 E501s, and the stale `work` ext description now matches reality
  (`{log, attempts, quota_hits, retry_at}`).
- **`examples/notifier/` adopted** (kanban-notifier: wait_changes feed → Slack DM,
  replaces lane-watch + context-watch delivery; a deployed copy runs in the engineer
  profile). Fixed the example writing its runtime cursor INTO the repo — state dir is
  now `$KANBAN_NOTIFIER_DIR` (default `~/.local/state/kanban-notifier`); the stray
  cursor file and `__pycache__` are purged.
- **Board hygiene after the dispatcher misfire:** 13 attention flags cleared with
  attempts reset (work ext rewritten whole — Q17), and the `staging` column's category
  fixed `unstarted` → `backlog` so parked cards are never auto-dispatched.

## 2026-07-05 (night) — Phase D live: the board became autonomous

- **kanban-dispatcher v0 built** (subagent, 6 commits in its repo: MCP client over
  stdio, strict routing.yaml, claude launcher, dispatch loop with claims/heartbeats/
  poison protection, CLI with --once/--dry-run; 33 tests + strict verify green) and
  **the live smoke PASSED**: a real card, claimed by `agent:dispatcher`, worked by a
  real headless claude worker (`agent:claude-code`) that commented and moved it
  ready→running→done via LEGAL transitions — it hit the flow denial, used
  `list_transitions`, took the legal path unprompted. Full attributed chain:
  change-log seq 1675–1684. The smoke card sits in done for Jan to see.
- **Two fixes en route:** kanban-pro gained a `py.typed` marker (downstream mypy saw
  us as untyped); the claude CLI `--allowedTools` variadic-flag trap is documented in
  the dispatcher's example config (`=` form required).
- **Adaptation plan: A ✅ B ✅ C ✅ D ✅ (v0).** Phase E (stop legacy dispatcher,
  retire built-in kanban) deliberately awaits Jan, as agreed. Hermes gateway MCP
  reload also still pending (Jan's action).

## 2026-07-05 — Inline one-card flows (75 tests); dispatcher build deferred

- **Inline flows shipped as ruled:** `ext["kanban_pro.flow"] = {states, transitions}`
  gives ONE card its own rules — resolution chain step 0 (inline > named scheme >
  default > free-roam), validated by the same builder as flow.yaml (`_build_flow`
  extracted, "inline" reserved alongside "free-roam"). Enforced even on profiles
  with NO flow.yaml — attaching a flow is an explicit request; the WORKFLOW
  fulfilment still reflects only profile config (documented). Malformed → default
  scheme + warning + `fell_back` note; `list_transitions` reports `source: "inline"`.
- **Dispatcher v0 build attempt aborted:** the subagent hit the session API limit
  (resets 22:50) with ZERO code written — kanban-dispatcher repo still docs-only.
  Re-run the build after reset; the full brief is preserved in the session.

## 2026-07-05 — Phase C landed: skills unified in ~/.agents, all harnesses wired

- **Discovery that simplified everything:** `~/.claude/skills` is a SYMLINK to
  `~/.agents/skills` (Jan's Dropbox-synced cross-tool assets), and Hermes already
  loads that dir via `skills.external_dirs` — so the repo's sample skills are
  automatically the ONE source for Claude Code, Hermes, and OpenCode. No copies to
  maintain.
- **Hermes kanban skills = two-layer structure** (deliberately NOT a rewrite): the
  old skills' content still serves legacy-dispatched workers (workspace kinds,
  tenant isolation, KANBAN_GUIDANCE companion) until phase D — each got a prepended
  "the board moved" routing section: legacy worker → finish on the old board with
  old tools; everyone else → kanban-pro MCP + the shared skills. Includes the
  old→new tool mapping (`kanban_block --kind needs_input` → `raise_attention`!),
  the no-dual-write rule, and idempotency-key habit. v2.0.0 → 2.1.0.
- **OpenCode registered** (`agent:opencode` in opencode.json, backup taken) — all
  three harnesses now carry the MCP with distinct actors.
- **`kanban_tools.py`/prompt_builder KANBAN_GUIDANCE left untouched by design:**
  they serve the legacy dispatcher's workers and retire with it (phase E).
- Remaining before E: dispatcher v0 (phase D, ~/workspace/kanban-dispatcher),
  api-/browser-verify skill switch (follows the workers), Hermes gateway MCP reload
  (Jan, whenever).

## 2026-07-05 — Idempotency keys + attention flag (72 tests)

- **Idempotency (decision 8, v1):** `core/dedupe.py` DedupeStore (kind+key →
  serialized original result, 24h TTL, per-profile `dedupe-<profile>.db`,
  opportunistic GC; kinds namespace keys so a card key can't collide with a comment
  key). The five create/add ops take an OPTIONAL `idempotency_key`: a retry with the
  same key returns the ORIGINAL entity — no duplicate on the board, no second
  change-log event. Required-key enforcement flips on with the phase-C worker rollout
  (the worker skill will always send one). No server-generated fallback keys, per the
  decision (a per-attempt key dedupes nothing).
- **Attention flag (as ruled):** `raise_attention(card_id, reason, for_actor?)` /
  `clear_attention(card_id, resolution?)` — flag in `ext["kanban_pro.attention"]`
  (shallow-merge; clearing sets the key to None per Q17), events
  `attention.raised`/`attention.cleared` carry reason + target so notifier agents
  route straight off the feed. 38 MCP tools now.
- **The toolref drift guard earned its keep on its first real surface change:** the
  suite failed until `tests.toolref --write` regenerated the example skills;
  installed copies re-synced.
- Phase C of the adaptation plan is now UNGATED (keys exist) — next: the Hermes
  worker/orchestrator skill rewrite, then dispatcher v0.

## 2026-07-05 — Harness adaptation: phases A + B executed

- **A1 — flows live:** `~/.config/kanban-pro/flows-default.yaml` (example committed
  at docs/examples/): `default` scheme = the migrated agent lifecycle
  (triage→todo→scheduled→ready→running→blocked/review→done, deliberate done→ready
  reopen), `docs` scheme, no WIP limits initially (Jan's values pending). Verified
  on the live board: lanes constrained per scheme; unmodeled `staging` free.
- **A3 — ext conventions pinned** (docs/methods.md): `kanban_pro.*` reserved keys
  inventory, `work` = dispatcher's executor metadata, adapters namespace by backend.
- **B — Claude-side skills switched to the MCP:** `lane-watch` = change-feed
  consumer (cursor replaces snapshot diff; gains actor + forced-move visibility +
  resume-after-downtime; migration actors filtered); `context-watch` comments via
  `add_comment` as `agent:context-watch`; `visualize-skill` prefers the feed for
  side-effect signals.
- **Correction discovered:** `api-verify`/`browser-verify` run INSIDE Hermes
  reviewer workers (hermes `kanban_comment` tool) — updating them before workers
  move would break them → re-scoped to phase C. `kanban-lite` turned out not to be
  registered anywhere — nothing to unwire, directory deletion at phase E.
- **Next per plan:** idempotency keys (the phase-C gate), then the worker-skill
  rewrite; phase D belongs to ~/workspace/kanban-dispatcher.

## 2026-07-05 — Cutover (phase 1): kanban-pro is the primary board

- **Fresh import ran** right before switching: 172 cards / 608 comments / 55
  relations, idempotent re-run over the earlier import.
- **Claude Code registered** (user scope): `kanban-pro` MCP with
  `--actor agent:claude-code` — every session on this box now has the board.
- **Hermes registration STAGED, awaiting Jan's approval** (live-assistant config;
  auto-mode declined the edit, correctly): add a `kanban-pro` entry under
  `mcp_servers:` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` (uv run … kanban-pro-mcp
  `--actor agent:hermes`) + allowlist `- kanban-pro` in `platform_toolsets.api_server`.
  Backup exists: `~/.hermes/config.yaml.bak-kanban-cutover`.
- **Deliberately NOT done (phase 2, needs kanban-dispatcher):** stopping the Hermes
  dispatcher, retiring the built-in kanban toolset, OpenCode registration. The
  dispatcher subproject is seeded at `~/workspace/kanban-dispatcher` (SPEC: headless
  `claude -p` launcher first; opencode driven via sessions against the running
  server, never spawned; hermes self-manages transitionally).
- **Drift policy until phase 2:** kanban-pro native store = primary for NEW work;
  the Hermes board is legacy/reference — cards still created there (by the Hermes
  dispatcher flow) reach kanban-pro by re-running `kanban-pro-migrate` (idempotent).
  Avoid dual-writing the same card in both.

## 2026-07-05 — Work queue + claim/lease: the agent loop is complete

- **Did:** `core/work.py` (ClaimStore + Claim/WorkItem/WorkQueue) + four MCP tools
  (32 total): `list_work`, `claim_card`, `heartbeat_claim`, `release_claim`.
  68 tests green; smoke-tested on the migrated board (engineer's queue = 6 real
  cards with legal transitions inline; rival claim bounced with owner + expiry).
- **Claim/lease:** atomic CAS via SQLite conditional upsert (per-profile
  `claims-<profile>.db`; in-memory for the memory profile); TTL = visibility
  timeout; heartbeat renews; expired leases silently reclaimable (crash-redelivery,
  Hermes-dispatcher pattern). `card.claimed`/`card.released` are change-log events;
  heartbeats deliberately aren't. Claiming does NOT move/assign — the
  claim→assign→move convention stays explicit and visible.
- **Work queue:** workable = backlog/unstarted/started; assignee match = full actor
  or bare name ("agent:engineer" matches hermes-style "engineer"); cards leased to
  others excluded; **a card I hold a lease on appears regardless of assignment**
  (test-caught ruling); transitions inline per item (Jan); sort:
  started → unstarted → backlog, then position.
- The message-bus story is now real end-to-end: event stream with cursors ✅ +
  competing consumers ✅. Cutover's remaining blocker is only the Hermes-dispatcher
  consumption switch.

## 2026-07-05 — Migration ran: the Hermes kanban lives in the native store

- **Did:** `kanban-pro-migrate` (new console script + `kanban_pro/migrate.py`) —
  **generic port-to-port copy** (nothing hermes-specific in the loop: `--source` /
  `--dest` are profiles, so jira→native works the day the adapter exists). Boards,
  columns, cards **including archived history**, comments, relations; idempotent
  upserts (ids preserved; comment ids prefixed `<board>:c<id>` — per-board uniqueness);
  provenance `ext["kanban_pro.migrated_from"]`; positions assigned from source order;
  `--dry-run`; writes through the dest core stack → the import is actor-attributed in
  the change-log (`migration:hermes-import`).
- **Prerequisite shipped:** `list_cards(board_id, include_archived=False)` port
  expansion (all adapters + stack + MCP tool) — closes the "archived cards
  undiscoverable" gap AND was required for a faithful migration (the live board is
  108 archived / 64 live).
- **RAN FOR REAL:** 172 cards (108 archived), 608 comments, 55 relations imported;
  verified through the full stack. Hermes stays untouched + authoritative — cutover
  (re-point harnesses, dispatcher story) is the tracked remaining half.
- 63 tests green (migration faithfulness incl. ext preservation, idempotent re-run,
  dry-run writes nothing; archived-listing added to the contract suite).

## 2026-07-05 — Flow engine shipped (+ vision README)

- **Did:** `core/flow.py` + augmenting-layer enforcement (60 tests green):
  - flow.yaml loader: pydantic-validated, fail-fast on dangling references, reserved
    names protected; `hooks`/`wip_limits` keys accepted-but-ignored (syntax reserved).
    Location: `$KANBAN_PRO_FLOWS` > `~/.config/kanban-pro/flows-<profile>.yaml` >
    `flows.yaml`; absent = engine off (free-roam behavior).
  - **Named schemes per card** via `ext["kanban_pro.scheme"]` (shallow-merge makes
    assignment a one-key patch). **Reserved built-in `free-roam` scheme (Jan):** the
    named unrestricted flow — a free-roam card moves anywhere while the board default
    stays enforced; YAML may not redefine it.
  - Resolution chain implemented exactly as ruled: no-config→free, unset→default,
    unknown→default+warning (never freeze), unmodeled endpoints→free.
  - `move_card(force=true)`: skips flow+WIP validation, event carries `forced: true`
    — never silent. Enforcement skipped when the backend's WORKFLOW is native (trust
    hermes's engine).
  - `list_transitions(card_id)` (28 MCP tools now): resolved scheme + legal targets;
    sources flow / free-roam / free / **backend** (adapters can expose native
    transitions via the `NativeTransitions` hook — hermes returns ready/blocked/done).
  - `list_flows`: all schemes + states + edges + default + the free-roam builtin.
- **Did (agent):** README rewritten vision-forward (features ✅/🔜, comparison table
  vs Unified.to-style APIs / Composio Rube / Agent Kanban+Flux / per-backend MCPs /
  Planka+Vikunja, agent-session example, flow.yaml example) — then trued up post-flow-
  engine (flow items ✅, 28 tools, free-roam as a real reserved scheme).

## 2026-07-05 — Push-fed web UI + HTTP API (`kanban-pro-ui`)

- **Did:** built the secondary interface (kanban_pro/api/) + a self-contained board
  page. `kanban-pro-ui --profile <p> --actor <a> [--port 8747]` — the ONLY way the UI
  starts (optional/on-demand rule). Routes: meta (profile/actor/fulfilments), boards,
  board snapshot (+change-log cursor), card detail + comments, move, add-comment,
  `/api/changes` (pull), **`/api/events` (SSE push)**. Canonical errors → HTTP status
  by taxonomy code. 55 tests green incl. a real-uvicorn SSE test proving a write is
  pushed to a connected browser with zero client action.
- **Push mechanics:** browser gets ONE snapshot (carries the change-log cursor), then
  SSE deltas; reconnect resumes via Last-Event-ID (browser-native). Server side:
  `ChangeLog.wait_for_change()` — same-process writes wake the stream instantly;
  writes from other processes sharing the SQLite log surface within the 2s re-check.
  No polling in the browser, ever (Jan's rule).
- **UI page (v1, deliberately minimal):** dark board, columns by `order` with
  WIP counts, DnD card moves (server round-trip; the SSE event refreshes the view —
  the UI trusts the log, not its own optimism), card modal with comments + add-comment
  (author defaults to the server actor). Board selector for multi-board profiles.
  Richer Hermes-plugin port stays queued.
- **Gotcha:** `httpx.ASGITransport` buffers entire responses — an endless SSE route
  hangs it; the SSE test runs a real uvicorn on an ephemeral port instead.
- **Verified live over `--profile hermes`:** real board renders (64 cards, 9 lanes
  incl. ad-hoc `staging`), SSE stream opens, capabilities honest.

## 2026-07-05 — Actor identity + change-log core (decisions 9 & 10 live)

- **Did:** `core/changelog.py` (ChangeEvent + ChangeLog: append-only, seq-cursored;
  SQLite per profile at `changelog-<profile>.db`, in-memory for the memory profile) and
  `core/recording.py` (`RecordingBackend` — outermost core decorator; stamps every
  SUCCESSFUL write with the connection's actor; reads + failed writes never recorded;
  slim payloads). Stack is now `Recording(Augmenting(adapter))` from
  `config.build_backend(profile, actor)`. MCP: `--actor kind:name` /
  `$KANBAN_PRO_ACTOR` + `list_changes(since, limit)` pull-feed tool (26 tools).
  52 tests green.
- **Decision (SPEC 10):** actor = per-connection plain string (`agent:…`/`human:…`),
  not a User reference; per-call override deferred.
- **Design note:** comment events keep both identities — the change-log `actor` (who
  called) and the comment's `author` field — they can legitimately differ.
- **Next projections of the same log:** WS/SSE + MCP notifications (with the UI),
  hermes `task_events` ingestion, card activity timeline.
- **Queued (Jan, this session):** `list_transitions(card_id)` MCP tool (valid moves
  per card) + **per-card workflow schemes** (a docs task skips coder steps — Jira
  issue-type-scheme style, named flows in the YAML, card carries `scheme`). → TODO
  flow-management block.

## 2026-07-05 — HermesAdapter: first remote adapter live

- **Did:** `adapters/hermes/` package (mapping / reader / writer / adapter), profile
  `hermes` registered, 47 tests green, read-only smoke against the REAL board passed
  (64 live cards, ad-hoc `staging` lane synthesized, comments + fulfilments correct).
- **Shape:** reads = direct SQLite per board (default + `kanban/boards/<slug>/`);
  writes = `hermes kanban` CLI (injectable runner for tests), board targeted via
  `HERMES_KANBAN_BOARD` env. Lanes → synthesized Columns (`<board>:<lane>` ids,
  categories per docs/hermes-kanban.md); `archived` lane ⇄ canonical archived flag;
  task_links ⇄ PARENT relations (synthetic id `parent->child`); harness fields in
  `ext["hermes"]`; `--idempotency-key`/`--created-by`/`--priority` pass through on
  create.
- **Honest CLI-bound limits (documented in the adapter docstring):** no unarchive
  verb; update_card = assignee only (`reassign`); move_card enters only
  ready/promote, blocked/block, done/complete — other lanes = not_supported
  (Hermes's own WORKFLOW enforcement, declared native). Card delete maps to
  `archive --rm`, which purges only archived tasks — same rule as our decision-7
  guard, enforced on both sides.
- **UI note (Jan):** any web UI stays OPTIONAL and on-demand (explicit flag, never
  default) — recorded in TODO.

## 2026-07-05 — Goal shift: replace the Hermes kanban

- **Decision (Jan):** kanban-pro now aims to **replace** the Hermes built-in kanban,
  not just proxy to it ("it was not at the start but it is now"). Native store becomes
  the system of record; the Hermes harness becomes an ordinary MCP/CLI consumer.
- **Sequencing unchanged:** the `hermes` adapter is still built first — as the
  discovery vehicle for the harness's real data shapes and the migration path
  (adapter reads Hermes → native store imports), with transitional proxy/sync until
  cutover. Recorded in SPEC (Purpose) + TODO (migration item).
- Kicked off read-only discovery of the Hermes kanban surface (background agent).

## 2026-07-05 — Hermes kanban discovered & mapped (docs/hermes-kanban.md)

- **Did:** background agent swept `~/.hermes` read-only; full map + canonical mapping
  recorded in docs/hermes-kanban.md. Headlines: SQLite per board; lanes ARE statuses
  (extensible vocab, `archived` is a lane → our flag); tasks are agent-work-rich
  (assignee=profile, priority, claims/heartbeats/runs, block kinds, created_by,
  **native idempotency_key**, `task_events` audit stream = our change-log concept
  independently invented); `task_links` DAG = our PARENT/CHILD relations; no labels,
  no due dates, no in-lane ordering; comments 608 strong on the live board.
- **Decision (proposed):** adapter access = **SQLite reads + `hermes kanban --json`
  CLI writes** (raw SQL writes would bypass engine invariants: event emission,
  ready-recompute, CAS claims).
- **Model implications adopted into TODO:** claim/lease op is a real requirement
  (Hermes dispatcher proves it); `priority` qualifies for core promotion (Hermes+Jira);
  actor identity validated (`created_by`, comment `author` exist there).
- **Agent-native validation:** Jan's direction (agent assignees, transition/error
  logging, work queue) mirrors what Hermes already does — kanban-pro generalizes it
  behind the canonical model instead of a harness-private schema. Containerized
  workers can't run the Hermes CLI (documented gap) — kanban-pro's MCP fixes that.

## 2026-07-05 — v1 core: augmenting layer + BaseAdapter + contract suite

- **Did:** built the adapter-structure plan's build-order steps 1–2 (38 tests green):
  - `adapters/_base.py` — `BaseAdapter`: whole port as `NotSupported` defaults, empty
    capabilities; thin remote adapters subclass and override only what's native.
  - `core/augment.py` — `AugmentingBackend(adapter, overlay)`: per-capability routing
    (native → adapter, polyfilled → overlay/enforcement, else `not_supported`),
    `fulfilments()` map. v1 slice: **WIP-limit enforcement** (Tier 1 — checked on
    create/move/add_placement into a column; skipped when the backend enforces
    natively; re-positioning within a full column allowed) and **comments/relations
    overlay polyfill** (Tier 2 — overlay rows keyed to backend ids; `delete_card`
    GCs them). WORKFLOW stays unavailable (flow-YAML pending); ARCHIVE polyfill +
    write-through + reconciliation-GC deferred (TODO).
  - `tests/contract_suite.py` — the shared behavioral suite; memory, native, and
    augmented-memory all inherit it (dedup of the copied scenarios). Native keeps its
    persistence-across-reopen test; `test_augment.py` adds a thin `StubRemote` proving
    gap-filling + honest fulfilment reporting.
  - Wiring: `config.build_backend` now returns the adapter wrapped in
    `AugmentingBackend` — interfaces call core, per the architecture. The MCP
    `capabilities` resource reports real fulfilments (wip_limits shows `polyfilled`).
- **Consequence:** WIP limits are now actually enforced for every profile — the first
  differentiator feature live.

## 2026-07-05 — Port expansion: Q14–Q17 implemented

- **Did:** implemented the morning's rulings across port + both adapters + core + MCP
  + tests + methods.md (25 tests green):
  - `add_placement` / `remove_placement` in the port and both store adapters (Q15);
    one placement per board; removing the last placement raises `conflict` (archive
    instead); `add_placement` verifies the target board exists.
  - `move_card` strict within-board (Q16): raises `not_found` if the card isn't on
    `to_board_id`; the silent placement-add is gone. Error message points at
    `add_placement`.
  - `core.delete_board_guarded` / `delete_column_guarded` (Q14, empty-only, live
    cards block; archived leftovers cascade on board delete). MCP delete tools route
    through them. Note: column→board lookup lives in core (the port has none).
  - `domain.apply_patch` — the single implementation of patch semantics incl. the
    Q17 `ext` shallow-merge (`None` removes a key); both adapters' six update methods
    now use it (was: whole-dict replace via `model_copy`).
- MCP surface: 25 tools (+`add_placement`, `remove_placement`).

## 2026-07-05 — Q13–Q17 ruled (delete guards, placements, move, identifiers, ext)

- **Q13:** guarded delete confirmed (archive → then delete); strict archive-only
  rejected — agent boards accumulate garbage, a deliberate two-step purge stays.
- **Q14:** `delete_board`/`delete_column` get **empty-only guards** (refuse while live
  cards remain; archived leftovers cascade on board delete). No board-archive ops —
  one core guard, no new port surface.
- **Q15:** `add_placement`/`remove_placement` join the port **now** (Jan's call over
  deferring) — multi-board membership becomes explicitly editable.
- **Q16 (+ identifier brainstorm):** `move_card` is **strict within-board** — never
  creates a placement (the silent-add quirk goes); cross-board = add/remove_placement.
  **Mount-qualified addressing** decided for multi-mount (`jira/TASK-001`); **no
  lineage-encoded ids** (provenance in link/ext, identity stable). **Human-readable
  card keys** (per-board `PRO-12` style) queued as own TODO item.
- **Q17:** patching `ext` = **shallow merge**, `null` removes a key (replace rejected —
  it would let any lazy client clobber other writers' keys and kanban-pro's own
  `kanban_pro.*` provenance metadata). Pinned in SPEC decision 1 + domain patch-model
  comment; adapters currently replace — fix queued.
- Implementation of Q14–Q17 queued in TODO ("Port expansion"); QUESTIONS.md is empty —
  all Q1–Q17 resolved.

## 2026-07-05 — v0 MVP: MCP server over the store adapters

- **Did:** built the v0 milestone — `kanban_pro/mcp/` (FastMCP, stdio): 23 tools (one
  per port op, schemas generated from the domain models) + resources
  (`kanban://capabilities` with per-capability fulfilment, `boards`, `board/{id}`,
  `card/{id}`). Entry: `kanban-pro-mcp [--profile]` / `python -m kanban_pro.mcp`.
  Verified end-to-end over a real stdio client session.
- **Decision:** seeded `core/` with `delete_card_guarded` (decision 7) — adapters purge
  unconditionally, the guard lives in core so no interface can bypass archive-first.
  MCP dispatches destructive ops through core from day one.
- **Decision:** canonical error classes carry a stable `code` (`not_found`, `conflict`,
  …); the MCP layer surfaces `"{code}: {message}"` tool errors. Tools carry MCP
  annotations (readOnly/destructive/idempotent hints) for harness UX.
- **Decision:** `config.py` registry implemented: profiles `default`→native (SQLite at
  `$KANBAN_PRO_DB` / XDG data dir), `native`, `memory`; `$KANBAN_PRO_PROFILE` selects.
  Profile files + secrets handling deferred to the first remote adapter.
- **Scope note:** idempotency keys (decision 8) intentionally NOT on the v0 tools — a
  required key without the core dedupe cache would be a false promise; both land in v1.
- **Queued (Jan, this session):** flow-YAML **force-transition** override (logged, never
  silent), **good logging** story, **smart Jira caching** (local cache + delta fetch by
  updated-since/hash), **monitoring HTTP server** flag — all in TODO.md.
- **Decision (Jan):** the `jira` adapter will be **MCP-backed** — kanban-pro connects as
  an MCP client to the Atlassian MCP when available, else errors with an install
  suggestion; raw REST only as targeted fallback. Details + caveats in TODO.
- **Research (background agent):** web survey suggests the concept combo (self-hosted
  backend-agnostic kanban proxy + capability polyfill/fulfilment + MCP-first +
  agent-safety semantics) has no direct prior art; nearest neighbors: Unified.to-style
  task APIs (SaaS, normalize-only), MCP mega-aggregators (Composio Rube), agent-native
  boards (Agent Kanban, Flux — worth a look for tool-design ideas), per-backend MCP
  servers (Atlassian/Linear). Differentiators confirmed: augmentation + fulfilment
  reporting, write-through polyfill, archive-first deletion, proxy-owned idempotency.

## 2026-07-05 — Docs unification & milestone rescope (review pass)

- **Did:** full doc↔doc / doc↔code consistency pass (Claude review, applied on Jan's OK).
- **Fixed drift:** README + AGENTS.md still described the superseded gated-surface,
  HTTP-first design → now match SPEC (augmenting proxy, MCP/CLI primary, interfaces call
  `core/`, never adapters). `Fulfilment` docstring in `ports/` corrected to
  write-through-first (was "overlay only"). SPEC's Column model now lists `category`
  (was only in code + research notes). methods.md "decision 7-bulk" mislabel fixed.
- **Decision — milestone rescope (Jan OK'd "basic but usable first"):** Roadmap split
  into v0 (MCP server over the native store — usable, no events/dedupe/augmenting) →
  v1 (Hermes + augmenting Tier 1 + idempotency keys + CLI) → v2 (change-log + pull feed
  + MCP notifications) → later (persistent webhook listener registry, content-hash
  dedupe, Tier 2). **Rationale:** decision 9's full push surface in v1 was
  product-sized plumbing before any real backend worked.
- **Decision:** idempotency keys required on ALL create/add ops (boards/columns
  included) — SPEC decision 8 aligned with methods.md, which already marked them.
- **Decision:** ordering = integer positions + periodic rebalancing (closed the stale
  "open question"; `Placement.position` was already an int).
- **Done earlier, now recorded:** domain models, wired port, `memory` adapter, `native`
  SQLite store (commits 8a0d340, 6ef1013, b9c1a4e) — removed from TODO.
- **Decision — Jira + local cross-board scope:** Jan wants a `jira` adapter alongside
  the local `native` board with cross-board copy/link/transition (pulls multi-mount
  forward). Ruled: **copy-once + provenance link first**, boards transition
  independently; mirrored transitions deferred until the v2 change-log exists; full
  two-way sync stays out of scope. Cross-mount links live in the overlay, keyed
  `(mount, card_id)`. → TODO "Jira adapter + local board".
- **Open → QUESTIONS.md Q13–Q17** (model gaps found in review): strict archive-only vs
  guarded delete; `delete_board`/`delete_column` guards; placement add/remove ops;
  `move_card` source disambiguation with >1 placement; `ext` patch replace-vs-merge.
  Also noted as port gaps: user lookup ops, archived-cards listing (methods.md
  "planned expansion").

## 2026-07-03 — Project Initialized

- **Decision:** Name `kanban-pro` — a backend-agnostic kanban proxy.
- **Decision:** Architecture = ports & adapters (hexagonal / anti-corruption layer).
  A canonical kanban model + a `KanbanBackend` port; each backend is a swappable
  adapter. **Rationale:** switching backend must be a config/adapter change, never a
  caller rewrite.
- **Decision:** Stack = Python 3.12+ / FastAPI / Pydantic v2 / httpx, uv-managed,
  ruff + mypy(strict) + pytest. **Rationale:** matches Hermes (Python, first adapter
  target) and the rest of the local tooling.
- **Decision:** Canonical **core + `ext` passthrough** rather than strict LCD or a
  union-of-everything model. **Rationale:** keep the common path clean while not
  discarding backend-specific richness. **Alternatives considered:** strict
  lowest-common-denominator (throws away Jira epics/sprints/custom fields);
  superset model (unusable, every backend implements a fraction).
- **Decision:** Adapters **declare capabilities**; core returns `501 Not Supported`
  instead of leaking opaque backend errors. **Rationale:** not every backend supports
  WIP limits / comments / reordering — make that explicit and queryable.
- **Decision:** Treat as a **personal/self-hosted tool** — skipped hiding AI-tooling
  files from git (Phase 8).
- **Note:** First real work = confirm Hermes kanban's API surface, then write the
  `hermes` adapter. A local/in-memory reference adapter is recommended first as the
  port's proving ground and test fixture.

## 2026-07-03 — Profile-gated surface & workflow-control roadmap

- **Decision:** The exposed API is **gated to the locked-in provider** — kanban-pro
  advertises only the ops the active provider supports, not a fixed superset. It's a
  *normalizing* proxy, not a lowest-common-denominator one. **Rationale:** full
  fidelity per backend. **Tradeoff accepted:** the surface changes per profile, in
  mild tension with "callers never change" — mitigated by the capability check +
  `GET /capabilities`. (Raised as a pushback; Jan chose fidelity over a frozen
  universal surface.)
- **Decision:** Provider chosen via **`--profile`** (`hermes` / `jira` / `default`),
  a named bundle of adapter + settings; env `KANBAN_PRO_PROFILE`. **Rationale:**
  callers pick a profile, not a code path.
- **Decision:** **v1 = Hermes parity** — support Hermes's full kanban method set
  first; other providers implement their subset and declare the rest unsupported.
- **Decision (roadmap):** **Workflow control via allowed transitions** — a later
  phase models permitted column→column transitions as a per-board state machine,
  declared by a `WORKFLOW` capability; `move_card` validated against it. Free-move
  stays the default for backends without a workflow.

---

## 2026-07-03 — Backend API research (15 products) + native store decided next

- **Did:** surveyed 15 kanban/tracker APIs (Jira, Linear, Asana, monday, ClickUp,
  Trello, GitHub Projects, GitLab, Notion, Kanboard, Wekan, Focalboard, Planka,
  Vikunja, Taiga) across auth, methods, workflow, relations, retry, webhooks/heartbeat,
  custom fields. Full writeup: `docs/research/kanban-backends.md`.
- **Decision:** **Native store is the next build**, sequenced after this research
  (before the Hermes adapter). References: Planka (schema + realtime), Vikunja
  (relations + WIP). It doubles as the port's reference/proving-ground.
- **Finding → design:** only Jira enforces workflow transitions server-side →
  kanban-pro's own transition/WIP enforcement is a differentiator, not LCD.
- **Finding → design:** `Column` gains a **category enum** (Linear's
  triage/backlog/unstarted/started/done/canceled) for portable "done-ness."
- **Decision:** card placement is a **`placements[]` set** of `{board_id, column_id,
  position}`, not a single `column_id` — one-card-one-column is violated by Asana/
  ClickUp/monday/GitLab/Jira. Single-board backends + native store use the degenerate
  one-entry case; `move_card` now takes `(board_id, column_id, position)`;
  `MULTI_BOARD_MEMBERSHIP` capability advertises >1 placement. (SPEC decision 4.)
- **Finding → design:** typed relations behind `RELATIONS` cap + `RelationKind` enum
  (modeled on Vikunja, inverse-paired). Expanded the `Capability` enum in `ports/`.
- **Finding → design:** no backend has idempotency keys and retry signals differ
  (Linear returns HTTP 400 not 429) → the proxy core owns normalized retry + create-
  dedupe + reconciliation polling + per-adapter keepalive/refresh (Jira 30-day webhook
  expiry, Asana 8h heartbeat) + a unified event surface for clients.

## 2026-07-03 — Augmenting proxy: polyfill backend gaps (supersedes gated surface)

- **Decision (supersedes decision 2's "gated surface"):** kanban-pro exposes the FULL
  canonical surface and **augments** the backend — delegate what the backend supports,
  **polyfill the rest from its own overlay store**, `not_supported` only when neither is
  possible. `GET /capabilities` reports each capability's `Fulfilment`
  (native/polyfilled/unavailable). Added the `Fulfilment` enum to `ports/`.
- **Rationale:** use everything Hermes offers, fill the gaps ourselves → a uniformly
  rich API regardless of backend richness.
- **Architecture:** `AugmentingBackend = adapter + overlay` decorator over the port; the
  **overlay is the native store** — so that build serves double duty (standalone backend
  + augmentation layer). Adapters stay thin and only declare NATIVE capabilities.
- **Tradeoff accepted:** polyfilled data lives only in kanban-pro → it becomes a
  **partial system of record** (invisible to the backend's own UI; overlay durability +
  orphan-GC reconciliation now matter; polyfilled semantics are shallow). Fine for a
  personal all-through-kanban-pro setup.
- **Polyfill tiers:** T1 pure enforcement (workflow transitions + WIP — no data split;
  where the workflow-control roadmap actually lands), T2 overlay data keyed to backend
  IDs (relations/custom-fields/comments), T3 hard (ordering/multi-board) last.

## 2026-07-03 — Interfaces are MCP-first + shell-first (harness-native)

- **Decision (SPEC decision 5):** primary consumers are agent harnesses, so kanban-pro is
  **MCP-first and shell-first**, not HTTP-first. MCP server exposes every canonical op as a
  tool ("skill") + the active provider's Capability/Fulfilment as a resource → any harness
  (Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, GPT, …) introspects skills and calls them with no
  bespoke integration. CLI covers shell-first harnesses; HTTP is secondary. All three are
  thin layers over one `core/` service — no drift.
- **Rationale:** "every known harness should natively understand the kanban" (user). MCP +
  shell are the universal harness interfaces; a per-harness client list doesn't scale.
- **Resolves Q1** (the Hermes/openclaw/Claude/GPT list generalizes to all harnesses).
  Added `core/`, `mcp/`, `cli/` to the project structure.
